# v4.9: Huge performance improvements, try version 5 preview

In Dark Reader 4.9.9 we've done enormous amount of **performance improvements**.
The loading speed of some huge web pages has increased **5x times**.
Firefox users should now get nearly the same experience as Chrome users have.

That means the loading speed when Dark Reader is activated should be about the same as without it.
For those users who have slow computers we will keep improving **Static mode**.
**Filter mode** can be used as a workaround too.

### A known issue in version 4.9.12 in Gmail

There is a bug with Gmail custom themes
that have a background image.
As a workaround try choosing a default theme in Gmail settings.
We will fix it soon.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

are available in the current app instance.

Some of the most requested features are **already available** in version 4.9.11:
- Custom background, text and selection colors (under **Theme** click **See all options**, **Colors**).
- Ability to disable scroll bar styling (under **Theme** click **See all options**, **Colors**).
- Ability to disable the extension for PDFs (click **Settings**, **Enable for PDF files**).
