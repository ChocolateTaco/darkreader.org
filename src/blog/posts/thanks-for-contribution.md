# Dark Reader raised funds, what's next

Last week we have started a [crowdfunding campaign](../dynamic-theme/).

Sorry for that disturbing splash screen. That was a hasty decision to open a new tab as soon as app updates.

As you may have noticed, the News section has been added that will highlight important events and release notes.

### Our annual budget reached $2000

More than 140 users [made their contributions](https://opencollective.com/darkreader/donate), making it possible to actively overcome the new challenges for the next few months. Thank you all!

### What's next

We've received about 50 bug reports regarding Dynamic Theme mode.
In May we are going to polish the Dynamic Theme mode and fix inverting IFrames.
Then we should make it possible to store site-specific settings.

**Thank you for helping make Dark Reader better**.
